Liberastika fonts are based on Liberation Sans family which was designed
by Ascender Corp for Red Hat, Inc. The Cyrillic part of the fonts was
redesigned significantly. It was lost its metric compatibility with the
Arial font. This is done since the design of Cyrillic in Arial has
substantial flaws so no good quality Cyrillic could be based on this
metrics.

The fonts are distributed under the terms of GNU General Public License
Version 2 with the following exception:

As a special exception, if you create a document which uses this font,
and embed this font or unaltered portions of this font into the
document, this font does not by itself cause the resulting document to
be covered by the GNU General Public License. This exception does not
however invalidate any other reasons why the document might be covered
by the GNU General Public License. If you modify this font, you may
extend this exception to your version of the font, but you are not
obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception
statement from your version.

The sources and truetype fonts are at http://code.google.com/p/liberastika/
Tarballs are compressed with xz (use http://tukaani.org/xz/ or multiplatform 
7-Zip archiver http://sourceforge.net/projects/sevenzip/ version greater than 9 
for decompression).

Build and install instructions
==============================

You need fontforge (http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/), xgridfit
(http://xgridfit.sourceforge.net/) and font-helpers
(http://code.google.com/p/font-helpers/ ) in order to build fonts from
the sources. Also you should have GNU make and coreutils. At first you
must unpack/copy files from font-helpers into the directory where *.sfd
files are located. Then type

make

and truetype fonts will be produced. On systems with X.Org you may do

make install

as root to install fonts system-wide (/usr/share/fonts/TTF). Otherwise
copy *.ttf files into ~/.fonts/ directory. Then run fc-cache if you have
fontconfig.
